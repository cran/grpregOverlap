Description: Fit the regularization path of linear, logistic or Cox models with 
	overlapping grouped covariates based on the latent group lasso approach. Latent 
	group MCP/SCAD as well as bi-level selection methods, namely the group exponential 
	lasso and the composite MCP are also available. This package serves as an 
	extension of R package 'grpreg' (by Dr. Patrick Breheny <patrick-breheny@uiowa.edu>)
	for grouped variable selection involving overlaps between groups.
