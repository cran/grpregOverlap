# grpregOverlap

`grpregOverlap` fits the regularization paths of linear, logistic or poisson 
models with overlapping grouped covariates based on the latent group lasso 
approach (Jacob et al., 2009). Latent group MCP/SCAD as well as bi-level 
selection methods, namely the group exponential lasso(Breheny, 2015) and the 
composite MCP (Huang et al., 2012) are also available. This package serves as 
an extension of R package `grpreg` (by Dr. Patrick Breheny <patrick-breheny@uiowa.edu>) 
for grouped variable selection involving overlaps between groups.
